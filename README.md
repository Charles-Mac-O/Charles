## Overview

<a href="#">Charles</a> delivers professional HTTP traffic analysis enabling developers to debug web applications and APIs effectively. The application serves web developers, mobile developers, and QA engineers requiring detailed network visibility.

Response analysis shows server responses including status codes, headers, timing information, and body content. Understanding exact server behavior aids diagnosing backend issues, performance problems, or unexpected responses during <a href="#">API integration</a> debugging.

Bandwidth throttling simulates slow network conditions testing application behavior under poor connectivity. Network simulation verifies timeout handling, loading indicators, and offline modes function correctly ensuring applications work <a href="#">acceptably</a> across varying conditions.

Session recording captures complete HTTP communication sequences preserving request ordering, timing, and data. Recorded sessions enable detailed examination after incidents or collaborative debugging with team members providing <a href="#">documentation</a> for reported issues.

Request breakpoints pause traffic at specified points enabling manual inspection and modification before forwarding. Developers examine requests in detail, modify parameters, or alter responses before continuing transmission proving <a href="#">invaluable</a> for complex troubleshooting.

The proxy supports various protocols including HTTP, HTTPS, and SOCKS enabling diverse networking scenarios. Universal protocol support consolidates debugging within single tool regardless of <a href="#">application specifics</a> or networking requirements.

Integration with development tools streamlines workflows using Charles alongside IDEs and API clients. Certificate installation procedures facilitate HTTPS decryption while browser configuration enables traffic routing maintaining <a href="#">workflow continuity</a> during debugging.

Map local functionality redirects requests to local files enabling testing without deploying changes. Developers test modifications immediately without server deployment accelerating iteration during <a href="#">feature development</a> significantly.

Rewrite tools automatically modify requests or responses based on rules. Automated modifications simulate various server responses without manual intervention testing application behavior under <a href="#">different conditions</a> efficiently.

The application maintains detailed logs preserving traffic history for later analysis. Log filtering and searching capabilities help locate specific requests within extensive capture sessions during <a href="#">troubleshooting</a> investigations.
